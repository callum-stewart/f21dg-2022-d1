Meeting No. 1

Date: 17:00-18:00 12/01/2022

Attendees: All

### Outstanding Actions 
- N/A

### Agenda
- Discussion through specification 
- Deciding JS libraries/framework
- Report format and how we split the work
- Identify strengths and weaknesses of the team
- Initial Task Allocation 

### Decisions made
- Report Plan: Individual reports in markdown then finalise in a combined LaTex report (Sebastian to collate it)
- Technologies to be used: JS and JQuery with libraries (Frameworks may overcomplicate

### Questions
- specific parameters users should be able to edit in the app
- Can we set up server for static content? (How far is the no backend rule implemented)
- Expectations of pseudocode (the app or the formulae for transforms)
