## Minutes

  

Meeting No. 5

  

Date: 10:00-11:00 09/02/2022

  

Attendees: Callum, Bruce, Daniel, Abigail, Saad

-   Sebastian has Covid and was unable to attend.
    

  

### Agenda

- Run through presentation in preparation for meeting with Mike.
- Deliver status updates on project deadlines.

  

### Actions Made

*NB*: Majority of time spent during meeting was dedicated to rehearsal, so less time available to discuss status updates.

Callum (Task 1,2)

-   Got STFT implementation in JavaScript running, need to compare output with Cole’s Jupyter notebook to ensure validity of results.
    

Bruce (Task 3,6)

-  Converting prototype from Single threaded execution to working with Web Assembly workers, experiencing some conflicts between DOM model and JavaScript conversion due to Matplotlib, identifying workaround. 

Abigail

-	Made modifications to previously submitted Gantt chart to improve clarity
-	Experimented with Babble, other CSS/JS libraries required for front-end.
-	Thought through UX problems and identified libraries for pop-up ‘tool-tips’ to explain concepts behind tool parameters to users.

Saad:
-	Continuing learning of D3 graphing library, substantial learning curve but feeling optimistic. 

Daniel:
- Created the PowerPoint to be used during presentation and structured contents to match specification. 
  

### Outstanding Actions (For next week)

| Name | Task allocated |
|:-------|:---------------|
| Daniel | Continue to support team with any issues, proactively identify and propose solutions for risks encountered. Will also investigate redistribution of work to rebalance workload and/or split tasks amongst 2 or more group members. Define task specifications more concretely. |
| Callum | Assuming Pyodide experiments are successful, begin implementation of python STFT & EMD analysis backend. |
| Saad | Continue learning D3. Once we’re committed down either Python/JS or JS only path, will begin work on creation and embedding of graph output. Will work primarily with basic sinusoidal graphs but components will be extensible to support the other required signal types once the test data for these have been created. |
| Bruce | Wrap up final Pyodide/Web Assembly prototype with Web Workers. Verify shared global scope between Python and JavaScript so that data can be exchanged between frontend and backend. |
| Abigail | Continue investigations into suitable frontend libraries and create mock-ups of final interface. Time-dependent, however if available work will begin on implementing the ‘real’ frontend; the sooner we’re started the better. |
| Sebastian | Creation of test data for most, if not all, required signal types. This includes valid, expected test data, invalid/nonsensical test data and if possible corrupted test data (the latter of which we’re just expecting to be safely intercepted and handled.) Plans will also be created for a cohesive Unit testing and Integration testing strategy (i.e. so component builders know exactly what unit tests they will be required to write). |

  

### Decisions made

-	Task distribution will be revisited and adjusted accordingly; some members of the group have a measurably higher workload compared to others; shall attempt to realign this more fairly.
