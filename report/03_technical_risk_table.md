# Techincal Risk Analysis
## Risk Table
| Risk Number | Risk Description | Severity | Chance Of Occuring |
|:---:|---|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Using Cole's python code in broswer via `Pyodide` or other methods if necessary. <br/> It will be very beneficial if we can find a way to run Python code in browser to save us from translating the code to JavaScript. | High | High  |
|2|Cole's code braking during runtime. Very unique edge cases can cause the code to break but the majority must be fully working. <br/><br/> Possible extra problems caused if we are forced to translate parts of code from Python to JavaScript. |Medium|High|
|3|Initial functional requirements not fully planned out. |High|Medium|
|4|Problems with GitLab collaboration.|Medium|Medium|
|5|User interface of the front end missing features or badly designed. |Medium|Low|
|6| Requirements analysis document missing sections, have incomplete sections or sections aren't up to the specifications. |Medium|Low|


## Current Actions to Reduce Severity
| Risk Number | Person Responsible | Possible Action to Reduce Severity |
|:---:|:---:|---|
|1|Bruce|Create a test environment to test running Python code in browser via `Pyodide`, if unsuccessful test the other options discussed in the first meeting. |
|2|Callum|Run extensive tests on Cole's code in the Jupyter Notebook provided, test the main functionality outlined by the functional requirements. <br/>Run extra tests in a `Pyodide` environment to further test the robustness of both the code and the Python code running in browser.|
|3| Saad | If possible meet up with Cole and present the current requirements and get feedback from him and make any change to the requirements that he may suggest. |
|4| Sebastian | Have a seesion with the entire team to make sure every team member fully understands how collaboration in GitLab works. |
|5|	Abigail | Again a meeting with Cole would be ideal as he will know best what the users would look for in the front end, possibly discuss this in the same meeting as the requirements.|
|6|Daniel|Discuss the state of the current draft of the document in a meeting, if problems arise then chase up people responsible for certain sections or assign help to incomplete sections.|
